There are 2 raw files named 'raw_belsimpel' and 'raw_shopee_Sg' and 1 combined output file - output_shopee_belsimpel the desired output for reference.

The task is to write a function/class so as to process and manipulate the 2 raw files using Python such that the output file matches the given combined file ('output_shopee_belsimpel'). Also, would be nice to see additional checks added to see if the code works for different scenarios and won't break or give incorrect ouput.

Pay close attention to the 'Review Text' columns format in Belsimpel as it has 'Pros'(Pluspunt) and 'Cons'(Minpunt) added when required after the review part for Belsimpel.

Also, note the format for 'Review Text' in Shopee file which has 3 sections (Performance, Best Feature and Value for Money) in addition to the comment added afterwards.

Also, an additional symbol '.' has been added in 'Review Text' column to segregrate the sections. 

You can go to the 2 sources i.e. respective websites (shown in 'web-scraper-start-url' column of the raw files) for further reference.
